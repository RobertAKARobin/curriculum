  - Methods (Functions)
* List three useful methods for arrays and hashes.
* Demonstrate how variables are stored in memory using Ruby.
* Use "!" to modify values in memory.
* Examine Ruby symbols and data immutability.


### Intro

HEADS UP: We are covering a lot of ground today. It's going to be a fast-paced class, so please raise your hand if I breeze over something quickly.
* For small technical questions, please use Slack and one of the other instructors will help you out.

#### What is Ruby?

Server-side language
* Remember Robin's diagram from Week #1?

![Client-Server Model](http://i.imgur.com/AfiaMQP.png)

* Ruby resides in and is processed by a webpage's server.
* That means you can look at or mess with a site's Ruby code as you did with Javascript.
* We won't be including Ruby files in our HTML documents. You'll learn more about how everything we've learned so far comes together next week.

Next week you'll dive into back-end web development and actually start retaining information in a database
* Ruby will allow us to interact with that stored information and display it on the web.

#### What's Ruby like?

MINASWAN
* Does anybody remember this from Allie's lunchtime presentation last Friday?
  * "Matz Is Nice And So We Are Nice"
  * Ruby creator:
  * Mentality not only applies to how you should treat your fellow developers, but also the philosophy behind Ruby itself

Ruby as a "natural" language
* While it isn't exactly simple, a lot of its features are going to feel intuitive.  
  * Matz: "Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just like our human body."


#### Tools We'll Be Using

We'll be running Ruby the same way we used Node to run Javascript during out first class.

Ruby
* Install: `$ brew install ruby`
* Run a Ruby file: `$ ruby file_name.rb`

The REPL: Pry
* Allows us to run Ruby code one line at a time.
* Install: `$ gem install pry`
* Run REPL: `$ pry`
* Quit from REPL: `exit`
* Alternative: `$ irb`

### Some Differences From Javascript

#### Variables

No longer need to precede new variables with `var`. Just use the name of the variable!
* Snakecase: all lower case, words separated by underscores.
* You should still keep names semantic!

Variables are still assigned using a single equals sign ( `=` )

```ruby
my_favorite_animal = "flying squirrel"
```

Although we don't use `var`, there is still syntax to designate whether a variable is local or global.
* nothing implies `local` (e.g., `my_number`)
* $ implies global (e.g., `$my_number`)


#### No Semicolons!

Although your code will work if you close a line with `;`, common practice is not to use them.

#### Parentheses Optional

```ruby
number = 3
if number == 3
  puts "It's a 3!"
end
# => "It's a 3!"

if( number == 3 )
  puts "It's a 3!"
end
# => "It's a 3!"
```

You might notice me using and not-using them in similar situations.
* Let me know if it's not clear whether you should use them or not.


#### Puts and Gets

`puts` is the equivalent of Javascripts `console.log()`.

```ruby
puts "Hello!"
# => "Hello!"
```

Ruby also allows us to easily accept inputs from the command line using `gets`.
* Usually followed by `chomp`, which removes the new line generated by the user hitting return.
* Sometimes also followed by `.to_s` to convert the input into a string.
* Compared to Javascript and Node, which don't offer a simple way to do this.

```ruby
# Asks for and stores a command line input into the variable as a string.
puts "What's your favorite animal?: "
user_input = gets.chomp.to_s
```

### Primitive Data Types

#### Numbers

Ruby uses same arithmetic operators as Javascript
* `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
* `**` - Exponents
  - `2**4` - 2 to the 4th power

Same order of operations too: P.E.M.D.A.S.  

#### Strings

Words, just like in Javascript.
* Surrounded by single or double-quotes
* Ruby uses similar escape characters
  - [List](http://www.java2s.com/Code/Ruby/String/EscapeCharacterslist.htm)
  - Must instantiate string with double-quotes for escape characters to work.

```ruby
name = "Adrian"

full_name = "Adrian\nMaseda"
puts full_name
# => Adrian
# => Maseda
```

Not only can you concatenate strings, now you can multiply them too!

```ruby
# Concatenation
"Hello " + "there!"
# => "Hello there!"

# Multiplication
"Hello there! " * 3
# => "Hello there! Hello there! Hello there! "

```

##### Interpolation

Sometimes you will want to print out a string that incorporates a variable. For example...

```ruby
my_name = "Adrian"
puts "Hi my name is: " + my_name
```

This works fine. Things aren't so simple when that variable is of a different data type. Like a number...

```ruby
class_number = 6
puts "I am teaching WDI " + class_number
# => TypeError: no implicit conversion of Fixnum into String
```

In cases like the above, you either need to convert the variable to a string using `.to_s` OR use something called "interpolation."
* Surround the non-string variable with a hashtag and curly brackets: `#{variable}`

```ruby
class_number = 6
puts "I am teaching WDI #{class_number}"
# => "I am teaching WDI 6"
```

#### Nil

Ruby's "nothing"

#### Booleans

Still `true` and `false`.
* We'll be using them in conditionals and comparisons just like in Javascript.

Comparisons in Ruby are nearly identical to Javascript
* `!=`, `&&`, `||`
* `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`
  - Don't worry about `===` in Ruby. It [does not](http://mauricio.github.io/2011/05/30/ruby-basics-equality-operators-ruby.html) have the same application as in Javascript.

Truthiness and falsiness is a lot less complicated in Ruby.
* The only "falsey" values are `nil` and `false`.

#### Symbols and (Im)mutability

Symbols are immutable values. That means they contain the same value through the entirety of a program and cannot be change.
* Kind of like a string that never changes.
* Syntax: `variable_name = :symbol_name`
* No Javascript equivalent.

```ruby
favorite_animal = :dog

# Looks the same as a string when you print to console
puts favorite_animal
# => dog

# Alternative syntax
other_favorite_animal = :killer_whale
another_favorite_animal = :"flying squirrel"
```

You can convert symbols to other data types.

```ruby
# To string
favorite_animal = :dog
favorite_animal.to_s
# => "dog"
```

You can't change a symbol's value though...

```ruby
:dog = :bird
# SyntaxError: unexpected '=', expecting end-of-input
```

When/why would you use symbols?
* Make sure values that need to be constant say constant.
* Often used as keys in objects (hashes). More on that later this class.
* Enhance performance.

### More on Variables

Symbols are a good segue into variables and how they work in terms of memory allocation.

Haha!

![XKCD pointers comic](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e015a8e243f53ffecd9b18fc5c8d770dde1948cc/687474703a2f2f626c6f672e70726f7465637465647374617469632e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323030372f30352f706f696e746572732e706e67)

Why is that so funny? Because variables are pointers to values in memory.

![Variables in memory diagram](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/62b04af497f124fc9b11ec3802d73497f5c9e305/687474703a2f2f64326177357865326a6c647175652e636c6f756466726f6e742e6e65742f626f6f6b732f727562792f696d616765732f7661726961626c65735f706f696e74657273312e6a7067)

#### .object_id

We can use the `.object_id` method to demonstrate that two variables are pointing to the same object.
- Returns an integer identifier for the object that is automatically generated by Ruby

```ruby
a = 10
b = a

a.object_id
# => 21
# You will probably get a different number than 21.

b.object_id
# => 21
```

#### Bang! (The `!` Symbol)

Unlike symbols, other data types in Ruby are mutable.
* We can not only change what values in memory variables are pointing to, but we can change those values in memory as well.

Methods with an `!` attached to the end of them means that they will modify the object they are calling on.
* Things can get tricky when you have multiple variables pointing at the same value. For example...

```ruby
# a points to a memory location containing 5
a = "lowercase"

# b now points to that same memory location
b = a

# Call upcase! (with a bang) on the value be is pointing to.
b.upcase!
# => "LOWERCASE"

# That means a is now also pointing to the modified value.
a
# => "LOWERCASE"
```

#### Exercise: Variable Assignment (20min)

[Exercise: Variable Assignment](https://github.com/ga-students/addbass-instructors/blob/master/w01/d02_ruby_basics/exercises/variable_assignment.md)


### Data Collections

#### Arrays

An ordered collection of related values. Same syntax as Javascript arrays.
* Square brackets.
* Values separated by commas.
* Zero-indexed.

```ruby
# Ordered lists
numbers = [ 1, 2, 3 ]
animals = [ "dog", "cat", "horse" ]

# Select an array value according to its index
animals[0]
# => "dog"

# => Reassign a value at a specific index
animals[1] = "elephant"
animals
# => [ "dog", "elephant", "horse" ]
```

##### Array Methods

Ruby is very nice. It provides us with an extensive library of array methods we can use to traverse and manipulate arrays.
* [Documentation](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html)
* Can't go over them all, but chances are if you could do it in Javascript then you can do it in Ruby.

###### Push/Pop

These Javascript methods also exist in Ruby and are used the same way.

```ruby
numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]

# Push

#
```

###### Sort
* Organizes array values from lowest to highest. Numbers and strings.

```ruby
numbers = [ 3, 1, 5, 2, 4 ]
numbers.sort
# => [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
```

###### Delete
* Removes an argument from an array.
* If there are multiple instances of that argument, it will delete them all.
* Look up: `.delete_at()`, `.slice()`

```ruby
numbers = [ 3, 1, 2, 2, 4 ]
numbers.delete( 2 )
# => [ 3, 1, 4, ]
```

#### Ranges

Use ranges to quickly generate arrays of data types.
* Parentheses.
* Min and max value, separated by two periods.
* Generate array using `.to_a` method.

```ruby
# Generate array of numbers from 1 to 5 in increasing order.
(1..5).to_a
# => [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]

# Does it work on strings?
("a".."z").to_a
```


#### Hashes (Objects)

A unordered, "dictionary-like" collection organized by key-value pairs. Very similar to Javascript objects, but with some differences.
* Curly brackets
* Can use colons or "hash rockets" ( `=>` )

Keys
* Can be strings, symbols or integers
  - Shouldn't use integers though...


```ruby
# Keys as strings
# We can store any data type in hashes, including nested arrays and hashes.
{
  "teacher" => "Adrian",
  "students" => [ "Donut", "Peter", "Nayana" ],
  "classroom" => 2,
  "inSession?" => true,
  "schedule" => {
                    "morning" => "Ruby Basics",
                    "afternoon" => "Enumeration"
                }
}

# Keys as symbols
{
  teacher: "Adrian",
  students: [ "Donut", "Peter", "Nayana" ],
  classroom: 2,
  inSession?: true,
  schedule: {
              morning: "Ruby Basics",
              afternoon: "Enumerables"
            }
}
```

##### Hash Methods

Like arrays, Ruby also provides us with a library of hash methods.  
* [Documentation](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Hash.html)

###### .each_pair

Executes a code block for each key-value pair in a hash.  

```ruby


# Print out each key-value pair
```


### Conditionals

#### If-Else

Pretty similar to Javascript, with some differences.
* No parentheses or curly brackets required.
* Begin blocks using `if`, `elsif` (no second "e"!) and `else`
* We close the whole loop using `end`.
  - This will be used throughout Ruby when dealing with code blocks (e.g., method/function).

Here's an example where we check for height at a roller coaster...

```ruby
puts "Welcome to the Iron Rattler! How tall are you (in feet)?"
height = gets.chomp

if height < 4
  puts "Sorry, you'll fly out of your seat if we let you on."
elsif height < 7
  puts "All aboard!"
else
  puts "If you value your head, you should not get on this ride."
end
```

#### Case

Just like Javascript's `switch` statement. Here's an example that displays a certain greeting depending on a language input.
* Note that the default case begins with `else`

```ruby
puts "Hello there! Give me a language: "
language = gets.chomp.to_s

case language
when "spanish"
  puts "Hola!"
when "french"
  puts "Bonjour!"
when "wookie"
  puts "URRAAGGARHRHH"
else
  puts "I don't know that language."
end
```

### Methods

The equivalent of Javascript "functions."
* Many things are referred to as "methods" in Ruby. Right now, we'll be taking about methods that are not attached to an object (e.g., array, hash).

Components
* `def` - the Ruby equivalent of `function`
* `double` - the method name in the below example
* `number` - the argument name in the below example
* `end` - closes the method

```ruby
# A method that doubles a number. A number-to-be-doubled is taken in as an argument.
def double( number )
  doubled_number = number * 2
  puts "Your doubled number is #{doubled_number}"
  doubled_number
end
```

You may notice that the above function does not use the word `return` on its last line. That's because Ruby methods have a feature called **implicit return**.
* If you do not specify `return` anywhere in a method, it will automatically return the last line in the method.
* We highly encourage you to include `return` -- i.e., use **explicit returns** -- in your methods and make clear what the output of your method is. Like so...

```ruby
# A method that doubles a number. A number is taken in as an argument.
def double( number )
  doubled_number = number * 2
  puts "Your doubled number is #{doubled_number}"
  return doubled_number
end

double( 3 )
# => 6

# Without parentheses does the same thing.
double 3
# => 6
```

Ruby methods can also establish default argument values.
* In the below example, if we do not provide our `double` method with an argument, it will default to 5.

```ruby
def double( number=5 )
  doubled_number = number * 2
  puts "Your doubled number is #{doubled_number}"
  return doubled_number
end

# No arguments. Just call the function (i.e., type out its name).
double
# => 10
```

### Exercise: Temperature Converter w/ Conditionals (20min)

[Temperature Converter](https://github.com/ga-students/addbass-instructors/blob/master/w01/d02_ruby_basics/exercises/temp_converter.md)
* CREATE NEW REPO.
* Rebuild the temperature converter from our JS Basics class using Ruby. Must contain conditionals.
* Bonus: Build into a function that takes a (1) starting numerical temperature value and (2) a starting temperature type (e.g., Fahrenheit).




## To-Dos
* Collections
  - Time for: Combining/comparing? Documentation dive for methods?
* Memory
* How is the actual object ID generated?
* Why do ranges work on letters?

Functions
- is there an equivalent of hoisting?
