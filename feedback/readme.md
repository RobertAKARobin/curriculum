# Feedback on Feedback

On Monday, the instructors met to go over your Week 6 feedback and evaluations. These are the notes we wrote down about what we personally and we as a group could do better and think about.

## Things we're doing differently

### Our top 3
- **Improved approachability**: We really care about each of you. We feel we haven't been doing an adequate job of demonstrating that. While we want to foster your independence, perhaps we've been erring on the side of *too much* independence. We'll make a greater effort to check in on students and make ourselves available for answering questions, technical and existential.
- **Improved pacing**: This class is commonly described as "drinking from the firehose," but that doesn't mean we need to play into that expectation. We've already passed along to central GA your feedback on improving the Fundamentals pre-work. Additionally, we'll hold each other accountable on the pacing of our own lessons: not going too fast, and keeping an even pace in the amount of content delivered from class to class.
- **Differentiation**: We're going to further our efforts to provide content to suit the needs of students of all comfort levels. Starting next week, on Wednesday and Thursday one classroom will be used for review from 9 to 10, while the other classroom will be used for "looking ahead": a morning exercise, or discussion on an advanced topic.


In the spirit of transparency, we're also including all of the notes we collectively wrote down:

### Lesson Plans
- We need to continue making our lesson plans very thorough and comprehensive.
  - This may help us to slow down our delivery too.
- Students like "I do, you do" exercises, particularly when student gets to watch an instructor do code, and students replicate it in another similar scenario
- Improve hooks and framing: give overviews of what you will learn. Give a problem to solve, then solve it.
- Include more asides: bonus materal, things to Google, etc.

### Lectures

- Slow down our delivery.
- Maintain a respectful and politically-correct atmosphere.
- More checks for understanding: identify and call on individuals.
- Excitement leads to speed/scattered info: 
   - Adding example stories to lesson.  
   - Noticing it and adjusting: "I'm speeding up and getting louder, aren't I?  I love this stuff." And then pause, slow down.  Usually revisit what was just said.
- Timeboxing: "Temporal myopia" (nearsightedness of time) is not as much fun as it looks. Using external timers and the timer script has helped.

### Homework

- Students like "long-form" exercises
  - We will try to deliver week-long exercises when possible
- Prioritize Outcomes over class homework. Students feel there isn't enough time to do both.
  - If Outcomes homework, assign no or very light class homework
  - Ask Outcomes team about having orthogonal lessons/review running concurrently during Outcomes programming for students who don't want Outcomes support?
  - Outcomes submission process
 
### Feedback on your Progress

- How to provide feedback more promptly/meaningfully?
  - In the previous WDI, we left comprehensive feedback on *every* homework assignment. It was exhausting for instructors, and the students didn't seem to value it.
  - Can we incorporate students into the grading process?
  - Maybe homework feedback isn't what students are looking for... But additional one-on-one time doesn't seem to be it either?
  - Maybe students just need a clearer picture of how "well" they're doing?

### Instructor Vibes

- Be more approachable.
  - Be conscious of when we're being too outgoing, or not outgoing enough
  - Make an effort to not "hide" behind the computer. Challenge ourselves to be social human beings!
  - Make a bigger effort to approach students in-person.
  - More computer-free time with students?
- Being available for help
  - Make a calendar of when instructors are avaiable
  - Clarify that questions are *always* welcome; we may just redirect the energy to an online resource

### Morning Exercises and Attendance

- Differentiation
  - How to frame classes appropriately for students who feel comfortable with material *and* students who feel less comfortable?
  - Each morning, have one class do homework review and the other do an exercise or mini-lesson, and students choose their class?
- Late policy. Works nicely with "differentiated mornings" idea: if one class is doing homework review, the student can sneak into that class? (Is still marked as tardy)

### Pre-Work

>The pre-course materials made me feel prepared for this program.

Very low ratings! How can we make this better? Jesse is an active contributor to fundamentals!
- Spend more time on Fundamentals in early weeks of class?
  - Can't rely on students all having gotten same amount from Fundamentals since they will all have completed it differently
