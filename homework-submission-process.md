# Homework Submission Process

All homework assignments will have their own repository, under the `ga-dc` account.

1. Please **fork** new assignments. 
2. Then, **clone** your fork to your computer. 
3. Create a feature branch in the format of `yourname_solution`
4. Complete your work inside it. 
5. Then, **push** your completed work to your forked repository. 
6. Finally, make a **pull request** to the upstream repository (in `ga-dc`).

As always, please include:

1. Your **comfort** score, out of 5.

2. Your **completeness** score, out of 5.

3. A brief note describing where you stopped, what in particular you had trouble with, what went well, and anything else you feel like including!

**Even if you're not done, please make sure you've made a pull request with what you have completed by 9:00am each day.**

Note: On your submissions, please **phrase your questions as questions**! Physical question marks are our visual cues to know we should respond to something.

Also, please give us specific error messages or behaviors to take a look at. "Seeding the database isn't working" doesn't give us much to respond to. Instead, please phrase it as "Why does `rake db:seed` throw an error?" or "`rake db:seed` doesn't throw an error, but nothing shows up in the database. Why?"
